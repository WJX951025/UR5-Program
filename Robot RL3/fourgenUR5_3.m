function [pb, alpha] = fourgenUR5_3(BF)
%fourgenUR5_3 Generates frequency matrix and scaled learning rates for the
%        Fourier Basis function approximation. See also fourUR5_3
% 
% [PB ALPHA] = fourgenUR5_3(BF) Calculates all possible integer frequency 
% combinations of states using the Fourier Basis approximation scheme, the 
% learning rate vector and the scaling of each state.
%
% INPUTS:   BF.N: order of basis functions (typically 3-9)
%           BF.a: learning rate: 1x1 scalar
%           BF.r: matrix containing domain of x-values
%           BF.
%
% OUTPUTS:  PB: matrix containing all possible integer frequency combinations of
%           states for the Fourier basis function approximation
%           ALPHA: matrix or vector containing learning rates for each
%           basis function
