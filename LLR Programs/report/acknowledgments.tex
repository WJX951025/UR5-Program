\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Just like reinforcement learning, scientific research has a trial-and-error nature. The research for this master's thesis was no exception. Although a project plan was made at the start, the obtained results forced the project in certain directions that were not always foreseen in the beginning. Every choice made during research led to new questions and new options. 

I would like to thank my supervisors for providing lots of ideas and suggestions, while allowing me the freedom to make my own choices in the end. I owe many thanks to Prof.dr. Robert Babu\v{s}ka for his broad knowledge, numerous ideas and useful feedback. I would also like to thank my daily supervisors dr.ir. Gabriel Lopes, for his useful suggestions and enthusiasm, and ir. Erik Schuitema, for his advice and for placing this research in a practical context.

Finally, I would like to thank my family, Margot and friends. Although they could not give me answers to my research questions, they did provide the support that was needed for finalizing my master.
