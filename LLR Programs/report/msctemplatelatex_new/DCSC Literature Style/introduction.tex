\section{About \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}}

\LaTeX\ is a document preparation system for the \TeX\ typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, and much more. 

\LaTeX\ was originally written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport and has become the dominant method for using \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX\ anymore. The current version is \LaTeXe.

If you want to know more about \LaTeX\ you better read \cite{texbook}.\index{LaTeX} 

 
\section{About Acronyms}

This section contains an acronym of the \ac{DCSC}. The \ac{DCSC} is our department within the faculty of \ac{3mE} at \ac{TU}. \index{acronym}

Acronyms are automatically listed in the Glossary in the back of this thesis. You have to define acronyms in \texttt{glossary.tex} using \verb"\acro{ACRONYM}{Full text}". You print an acronym by using the command \verb"\ac{...}". You can always force a full, long or short printout by using \verb"\acf{...}", \verb"\acl{...}" or \verb"\acs{...}" respectively. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb"\acf{DCSC}": \acf{DCSC};
	\item \verb"\acl{DCSC}": \acl{DCSC};
	\item \verb"\acs{DCSC}": \acs{DCSC}.
\end{itemize}

\section{About the Nomenclature}

When you use symbols in your thesis -- as you probably will -- you can put them into the nomenclature listing (List of Symbols) at the back of your thesis. \tabref{tab:nomencl} shows the \LaTeX\ commands you need.\index{nomenclature}

\begin{table}%
	\centering
	\caption{Nomenclature codes}
	\label{tab:nomencl}
	\begin{tabular}{llcl}
		\toprule
		Code & Usage & Example\\
		\midrule
		\verb"\gsymb{}" & Greek symbols & \gsymb{$\gamma$}{Path Angle}\\
		\verb"\lsymb{}" & Letter symbols & \lsymb{$H(s)$}{Transfer function}\\
		\verb"\supers{}" & Superscript symbols & \supers{max}{Maximum} &\emph{only printed in the List of Symbols} \\
		\verb"\subs{}" & Subscript symbols & \subs{min}{Minimum} &\emph{only printed in the List of Symbols}\\
		\verb"\others{}" & Other symbols & \others{[kts]}{Knots} \others{$^{\circ}$, [deg]}{Degrees} &\emph{only printed in the List of Symbols}\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
