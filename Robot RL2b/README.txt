This folder "Robot RL2c" consists of matlab script and function
which implements the additive input compensator for 1 degree of freedom
actuation (joint 3) and two state space of RL (z and zdot)

"b" denotes that this program is implemented using radial basis function
 with pessimistic (result: bad) and optimistic (result: rather good) 
critic initialization. Subbu's method which is used to avoid overshoot is 
implemented.
